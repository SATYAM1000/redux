# Redux is a predicatable state container for javascript 

redux is a pattern and a library for organising global states in your application outside the react component tree.

# it provides a layer of seperation between the component where action has happened and the component where states updates

# npm i @reduxj
s/toolkit react-redux axios


# ui will trigger the events called actions

# reducers will have logics to update the state

# actions tell what happened and reducers updates state in response of that action
